Here I am discussing 5 key features of this project:-

* Home page has a nav bar where the primary routes are shown and a login and logout button with image and name has been set up. There a two more private routes in the navbar which are initially hidden when some one login only then he can access the dashboard and profile routes. Some additional features key responsibilities are explain in the home page other sections.

* In navbar when some ne click in the service route he driven to the service page and there are key services of the company are displayed in cards. There is a button in the card called see details when some one hit that button without login he will be driven to the login page and after successful login he would bring back to the desire page automatically.

* There is a register page anybody can create a account with valid email and password.

* I have implement AOS animation in the home page design.

* There is relevant footer in this project.

* This website is fully responsive.
